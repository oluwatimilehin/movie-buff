# Movie Buff
Movie Buff allows users discover the most popular and top rated movies playing. 

It fetches data from TheMovieDatabase API. You would have to generate your own API key and use it in the MovieActivity.java file. 
Users have the option to sort movies by 'Popular' and 'Top rated'. Selecting a movie loads up a new activity that displays details of that movie. 

It makes use of the Picasso library to load images and the Calligraphy library for custom fonts. 
This app is the first stage of the movie app built as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree curriculum.
